                <h2>On the Subject of Gerrymandering</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Justice is blind. Well, it turns a blind eye for the right price.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You live in Fantasia, a country located near the southern border of the equally fictitous Switzerland. Fantasia is, like most of the modern world, a representative democracy. Each district has an equal amount of voters that get to elect a representative.</li>
                    <li>A new census has came in and shown that the country has grown much more than predicted, meaning that district lines must be redrawn. You have been selected by the senate to generate the new district lines. Drag across blocs on the module to create a district containing those blocs.</li>
                    <li>You plan on doing the least amount of work possible when you are given a proposition from a senator. If you draw the new district lines such that it benefits his party, he will give you a massive paycheck, big enough for you to retire at the ripe age of 20.</li>
                    <li>You don't know which party he represents, but you are sure to find the color of his party on the envelope containing your paycheck.</li>
                    <li>Naturally, you take the offer and he leads you to the room with both the envelope and the map of district. You remember that in your training that you must divy up district lines such that each bloc has to have voters equal to the highest single-digit factor of the amount of voters in the district. The amount of voters is always listed at the top of the map.</li>
                    <li>Divy up the district lines such that it favors the senator's party, as well as following the rules of district line drawing.</li>
                    <li>For clarification: Each colored cell is one voter, with hollow regions being infested with land mines. The highest single-digit factor is a number from 1-9 that perfectly divides the amount of voters. A favored party is one that has more blocs that vote for said party. Voters can only be connected orthognally.</li>
                    <li>An example of a district map with gerrymandering can be seen on the following page.</li>
