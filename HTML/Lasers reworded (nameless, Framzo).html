                <ul>
                    <li>The module will initially show 9 closed hatches in a 3×3 grid.  Each hatch is numbered a digit from 1–9.</li>
                    <li>
                        Open 7 hatches to reveal 7 colored lasers in the order listed in the below table. At each stage, choose
                        a laser that is valid based on the rule listed in the table.
                    </li>
                    <li>Choosing a forbidden laser will earn a strike and reset the module to its initial state.</li>
                    <li>You cannot re-use an already opened hatch.  The numbers on the hatches do not change position.  Make it through all 7 stages to defuse the module.</li>
                    <li>
                        Based on the hatches chosen in earlier stages, it is possible to reach a later stage in which no remaining hatches are valid.
                        However, there is always at least one path that can be taken from start to finish that will not lead to such a situation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <table class="centered">

                    <tr><td style="text-align:center">3</td><td>Calculate 9 - the digital root of the sum of all digits in left column (if this is 0 use 9). Valid lasers are <b>not</b> in the same column as this number.</td>
                    <tr><td style="text-align:center">4</td><td>Any laser diagonally adjacent to the laser taken in the 3rd stage.</td>
                    <tr><td style="text-align:center">5</td><td>Calculate the digital root of (number of minutes originally on the bomb + 1). Valid lasers are <b>not</b> in the same row or column as this number.</td>
                    <tr><td style="text-align:center">6</td><td>If the number of modules on the bomb is odd: 2, 4, 6, 8. Otherwise: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td style="text-align:center">7</td><td>Any laser <b>not orthogonally or diagonally</b> adjacent to the laser taken in the 5th Stage.</td></tr>
                </table>

                <p>* Digital root is calculated by adding the sum of the digits of a number, and repeating until left with a single number. For example, 1356 = 1+3+5+6 = 15; 15 = 1+5 = 6, so the digital root of 1356 is 6.
                <p>** Lasers are orthogonally adjacent if they are to the left/right/up/down of one another (adjacent, not counting diagonals).
