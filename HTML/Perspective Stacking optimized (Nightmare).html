                <h2>On the Subject of Perspective Stacking</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“How to avoid the third dimension”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For each stage, in the tables below highlight the cell
                        that corresponds to the coloured square on the module,
                        your table number is displayed on the right*.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then note the darkened arrow on the right display and
                        apply the force of gravity using the following rules:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the arrow is an orthogonal direction, shift all coloured squares
                                in that direction until they collide with their table’s border.<br>
                                (Example: if the arrow is right, then C4 (Table 3) → E4 (Table 3))
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the arrow is a diagonal direction, shift all coloured squares
                                left/right throughout the tables while maintaining their position
                                in the tables. For the bottom-left arrow shift to the left until you reach <b class="ref">Table 1</b>, and for the top-right
                                arrow shift to the right until <b class="ref">Table 5</b>.<br>
                                (Example: if the arrow is bottom-left, then D2 (Table 4) → D2 (Table 1))
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If a square blocks another square’s path, the moving square will
                                halt its movement, stacking like expected.
                                HOWEVER if both of them are the same colour, they will instead merge
                                into one.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        them into the table on the next page, where the first column corresponds to the top
                        digit, and the second column corresponds to the bottom digit. When
                        using the table, if you’ve been told to change the color of a
                        cell, ignore all further instructions for that specific cell.

                    <li>
                        Using the buttons on the top-left of the module, colour the grid
                        accordingly, and press submit. Upon a strike, the module will cycle
                        through all previously displayed stages, press the submit button to return
                        to the submission state and receive a new pair of digits.
