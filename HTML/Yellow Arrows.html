                <p class="flavour-text">Points!</p>

                <p>On the module are 4 directional buttons, and a display screen in the middle.</p>

                <p>If the buttons are not Yellow, you’re looking at a different module.</p>

                <p>On the display is a random English letter. That is your <strong>Starting Row</strong>.
                    Then, take the last digit of the Serial Number plus one, and move down
                    that many rows. Perform that instruction, and move down again by the
                    same number (If Z is reached but you still have more down moves, loop back to A and continue).
                    Keep doing that, and the module will be disarmed after 5 consecutive correct presses.</p>

                <p>Pressing an incorrect button will register a Strike, and the module
                    will reset itself with a new <strong>Starting Row</strong>, and you must start over.</p>
