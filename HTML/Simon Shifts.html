                <p>Pressing any tile that is next to the status light will cause the tile and the status light to swap positions.</p>
                <p>Shift the tiles in such a way that the status light ends up in the center of the grid, while also making sure that the last set of tiles pressed all resulted in a shift, as well as the last set of shifted tiles is equal to the set of tiles that flashed in order for that stage.</p>
                <p>Press the status light to submit that stage. Successfully completing all three stages will disarm the module.</p>
