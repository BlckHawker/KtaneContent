                <p class="flavour-text">Space rocks!</p>
                <p>A shooting star is heading toward an asteroid belt! It’s your job to help it get through!</p>
                <p>Each asteroid has a little hole the star can fit in. Pick one of the top asteroids for the star to start in and then the asteroids will start rotating. Whenever the hole the star is in lines up with the hole on another asteroid, it will move to that hole. Only one asteroid on the bottom is safe to exit from.</p>
                <p>The rotations of the asteroids and the safe exit are written in the stars. Three sequences of nine flashes will flicker along the top, right and bottom. Take the three sequences and stack them on each other from top to bottom. Shift them such that there is no position where all three sequences are flashing or not flashing. Using the table below, each set of flashes from left to right corresponds to how each asteroid rotates in reading order. The first set contains a star that flickers smaller than the rest.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="img/Star Navigator/1.svg"></td>
                        <td><img src="img/Star Navigator/2.svg"></td>
                        <td><img src="img/Star Navigator/3.svg"></td>
                        <td><img src="img/Star Navigator/4.svg"></td>
                        <td><img src="img/Star Navigator/5.svg"></td>
                        <td><img src="img/Star Navigator/6.svg"></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>90 CCW</th>
                        <th>90 CW</th>
                        <th>180 CCW</th>
                        <th>180 CW</th>
                        <th>270 CCW</th>
                        <th>270 CW</th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>The three sets of flickering stars are also flickering at different speeds. If the shooting star is spinning clockwise, the safe asteroid is the one corresponding to the set of the fastest flickering stars where top = left, right = middle, and bottom = right. Otherwise, the safe asteroid is the one corresponding to the set of the slowest flickering stars.</p>
                <p>Picking an asteroid that doesn’t lead the star to the safe exit or getting the star stuck in a loop will cause a strike.</p>
