                <p>Ethan is in a coma. We are all in his dream.</p>
                <p><u>DO NOT WAKE HIM UP.</u></p>
                <p>The world as you know it is the dream of this coma patient. Experiences from Ethan's environment will ripple down to the defuser's room.</p>
                <p>If Ethan wakes up, his dream will end in the most narratively sensible way. This usually results in the bomb exploding.</p>
                <p>On the needy, there is a light switch and a battery display.</p>
                <p>The light switch controls the lights in Ethan's room, which affects the lights in the defuser's room by extension.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The switch will glow when the lights are off to make finding the switch in the dark easier.</li>
                    <li>The switch might change state due to pacing events or other modules. This usually means someone has come to check on Ethan.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The battery display shows the battery of Ethan's alarm clock. Inconvinently, it is the only way to wake Ethan up.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fortunately, the alarm clock's battery is depleted. Unfortunately, it is solar powered, and the lights in Ethan's room are enough to charge it.</li>
                    <li>Whenever the room's lights are on, the alarm clock will charge up (represented with the battery display and needy timer). When they're off, the battery's charge will slowly dissipate due to faulty hardware.</li>
                    <li>Once the alarm is fully charged, it will automatically sound off, as it is 5 years late.</li>
                    <li>Ethan's alarm sounds exactly like the bomb's strike sound effect. If it starts, Ethan will hear the strikes and they will manifest onto the bomb.</li>
                    <li>Once the alarm starts, there is no way to stop it within Ethan's dream. The bomb will blow up once Ethan wakes up. This might take longer if there are many strikes on the bomb.</li>
