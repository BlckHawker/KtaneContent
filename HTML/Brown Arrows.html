                <h2>On the Subject of Brown Arrows</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The point has fallen through a sinkhole.</p>

                <p>On the module are 4 directional buttons, and a display screen in the middle.</p>
                <p>If the buttons are not Brown, you’re looking at a different module.</p>
                <p>You are in a 6×6 crawl space underground. Within this crawl space is a wooden chest that contains the legendary treasure of The Gunk. The goal is to get this treasure, but unfortunately the key to the chest has been lost. Instead you must find 3 rocks hidden around the crawl space, pick them up, and hit them on the chest to break it open.</p>
                <p>The display will show the space in the crawl space you are currently in. Use the arrow buttons to navigate around the crawl space and press the display to pick up any rocks you find. Only 1 rock can be held at a time. To hit the chest press the display when you have a rock picked up and you are in the same space as the chest.</p>
                <p><strong>However, you are not alone in this crawl space. An underground creature is navigating around as well, changing its position after each time you move. If you are in a space adjacent to the creature a red LED will appear on screen in the direction of the space the creature is in.</strong></p>
                <p>Attempting to pick something up when nothing is around, hitting the chest with nothing picked up, or getting caught by the creature will cause a strike and reset the module.</p>
                <p><strong>If a Treasure Hunt module is on the bomb, then you’re lucky! The key is in the crawl space, no rocks are around, and the creature is gone. Simply pick up the key and use it on the chest to get the treasure.</strong></p>
