                    This module has three displays, each with an arrow to their left and right.
                    The bottom-most display also has a button above and slightly to the left of it.<br>
                    To solve the module the defuser must input the correct entries for all displays.
                    An incorrect submission will issue a strike.
                </p>

                    After the module is solved, go ahead and press the icon in the bottom right to celebrate!
                    Of course, it sometimes celebrates in strange ways...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first field from the top contains the three foods on the menu for the event you are scheduling.
                    For each food in this field, find its equivalent value in the table to the right.
                    Take the sum of all of these values to get value <b>A</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take each of the acquired values from the table, before summing them up, and interpret them as positions in the serial number.
                    Take the sum of these characters, converting letters to their alphabetic position where necessary. This is value <b>B</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After having determined both these values, look at the table below. Based on the day the bomb was started on, get Values <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>.
                    After going through the table take both values modulo 7. Should <b>C</b> now be 0, set <b>C</b> to 1</p>

                    <li>Otherwise, if today is Tuesday, read from top to bottom.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, read from bottom to top.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now go through the list of food items on page 1 in the specified direction, stopping at the first option whose value matches <b>C</b>. If this item is present on the module, this is the first display. Otherwise keep going through the table in the specified direction
                    until an option present on the module is hit, independent of what its value is.</p>
                <p>Now Convert <b>D</b> into a day of the week, via the table below, this will be entered into the second display:</p>

                <p>Finally, check the following conditions to obtain the third display:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is an Ice Cream module on this bomb, the third display is Sunday.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the obtained day value matches the day the bomb was started on or <b>A</b> modulo 7 matches D, the third display is Tuesday.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the number of ports on the bomb is even, the third display is Thursday.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are any vowels in the serial number, the third display is Wednesday.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are no Parallel Ports on the bomb, the third display is Monday.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is an indicator labelled FRK, the third display is Saturday.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, the third display is Friday.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If both obtained Days are different, press the button between displays two and three and enter both days normally. Should both days be the same, then leave the bottom display empty.</p>
