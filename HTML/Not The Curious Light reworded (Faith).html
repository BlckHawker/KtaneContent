                <p class="flavour-text">Guess the cat lives this time :D üêà</p>
                <p><i>See <b>Appendix: The Light</b> of <a href="../HTML/The%20Light.html">The Light</a> for help identifying the various versions of The Light.</i></p>
                <p>
                    This module presents with a single light that when tapped will transmit a sequence of 3 colours in either Cyan, Yellow, Magenta or Black.
                    There are 4 of these sequences, with each tap after the first cycling through to the next sequence, wrapping back around to the first after the fourth.
                    Each of these sequences is referred to as a wire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All 4 wires will have the same 3 attributes associated with them, one for each colour in the sequence, albeit the state of those attributes is different depending on the colours themselves.
                    To find out which 3 attributes you‚Äôre using, go through the conditions below, stopping once you hit a true condition:
                </p>
                <h3>Attribute 1</h3>
                <p>If the last digit of the serial number is even OR there are more lit than unlit indicators, the attribute associated with the first colour is <em><strong>Sea Level</strong></em>.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, if the bomb has at least 1 D battery, the attribute associated with the second colour is <em><strong>Lunar Phase</strong></em>.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, the attribute associated with the third colour is <em><strong>Sawdust Percent</strong></em>.</p>


                <h3>Attribute 2</h3>
                <p>If the bomb has a Stereo RCA, RJ-45, or PS/2 port, the attribute associated with the first unassigned colour is <em><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></em>.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, the attribute associated with the last unassigned colour is <em><strong>Baking Time</strong></em>.</p>

                <h3>Attribute 3</h3>
                <p>The colour that has yet to be assigned an attribute gets the attribute <em><strong>Light Colour</strong></em>.</p>

                    Now that you‚Äôve assigned each of the 3 colours in the sequence with an attribute,
                    look that attribute up with its associated colour to get a state for that attribute:

                <h3>Determining Which Wires to Cut</h3>
                <p>
                    You may cut a wire if the wire follows at least one of these rules.
                    If the UNLESS condition applies for that rule, disregard it as if it weren‚Äôt true.
                    If the attribute listed was not one of the 3 determined earlier, disregard the part of the rule that includes that attribute.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <em><strong>Sea Level</strong></em> is +20cm AND the <em><strong>Baking Time</strong></em> is exactly 20 min</li>
                    <li>The <em><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></em> is Rabbit or Goat OR <em><strong>Baking Time</strong></em> is 60 min, UNLESS <em><strong>Sea Level</strong></em> is negative or <em><strong>Sawdust Percent</strong></em> is 20% or 50%</li>
                    <li>The <em><strong>Sea Level</strong></em> is positive UNLESS the <em><strong>Light Colour</strong></em> is Magenta or Yellow</li>
                    <li>The <em><strong>Light Colour</strong></em> is Cyan or Magenta UNLESS the <em><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></em> is Goat or Fish OR <em><strong>Lunar Phase</strong></em> is New</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To cut a wire, Hold the light for at least 1 timer tick AFTER you play the 3 colour sequence corresponding to the wire you want to cut
                    (For example, tap to show the wire 2 colours and then hold to submit wire 2).
                    Once you cut a wire, the sequence corresponding to the next uncut wire will play and the sequence of the cut wire will no longer appear.
                </p>
                <p>Once all correct wires are cut, the module will solve.</p>
                <p>Upon cutting an incorrect wire, the module will strike and remove the incorrectly cut wire from the list regardless.</p>
