                <p class="comment">Somebody at Bomb Corp. got a bit lazy on the graphics.</p>
                <p>You may have noticed that there are some modules which (at least initially) appear blank. At first glance, all modules of this variety are indistinguishable*. Follow the instructions below in order to determine what module you are looking at.</p>
                <p class="note">* Note: The module <a href="Hinges.html">Hinges</a> has one or more hinges missing from the module casing, but is otherwise blank.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the module (but do not tap on it).
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the module begins to transform, you are looking at <a href="The Octadecayotton.html">The Octadecayotton</a>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Move the cursor back and forth over the module.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the module has patterns of dots on it, you are looking at <a href="Braille.html">Braille</a>.</li>
                            <li>If the module has shapes on it, you are looking at <a href="Polygons.html">Polygons</a>.</li>
                            <li>If the module has numbers and a shape on it, you are looking at <a href="Hidden In Plain Sight.html">Hidden In Plain Sight</a>.</li>
                            <li>If the module shows a big letter D, you are looking at <a href="D.html">D</a>.</li>
                            <li>If you hear a tone, you are looking at <a href="Deaf Alley.html">Deaf Alley</a>.</li>
                            <li>If you hear whirring sounds or a printer-like sound, you are looking at <a href="Eavesdropping.html">Eavesdropping</a>.</li>
                            <li>If you repeatedly hear “cow”, you are looking at <a href="Find The Invisible Cow.html">Find The Invisible Cow</a>.</li>
                            <li>If you hear the clicking sound that is played when hovering over a button <b>but do not have any visual feedback</b>, you may be looking at Blind Alley. Follow the instructions on the first page of that manual and press any valid region, then check the next condition.</li>
                            <li>(Skip if the previous condition was false) If the module made any noise or if, upon feeling all of the regions again, anything changes you are looking at <a href="Blank Slate.html">Blank Slate</a>. Otherwise, press the rest of the valid regions to solve Blind Alley.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Continued on the next page...</li>

                                It is safe to release at any time, but the click should be noted down as one press.
