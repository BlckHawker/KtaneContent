                <h2>On the Subject of Pinpoint</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The less you think about the technology which allows for status lights to be invisible when they’re not lit up, the better. To be fair though, modules that stopped being possible to recreate physically have existed since 2017, even worse if you only count modules that are reasonable to build, in which case bad offenders have existed since Wire Sequence.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module will cycle between 3 points on a 10 by 10 grid, each displaying their distance relative to some other point known as the target point.</li>
                    <li>Points on this module are centered at their corresponding square in the grid.</li>
                    <li>Locate the position of the target point to disarm the module.</li>
                    <li><b>The distance between adjacent points in the grid is arbitrarily chosen. Furthermore, each given distance is truncated to 3 decimal places.</b></li>
                    <li>Tap any grid square while the module is cycling to enter submission mode.</li>
                    <li>Tapping any grid square which is not the target point while in submission mode will result in a strike. The module will then return to the default state, and the answer will not change.</li>
                </ul>
