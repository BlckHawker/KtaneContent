                <h2>On the Subject of Tyler Verifies</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">We’re leaving bomb defusal in the hands of Tyler? Dear lord, please help us.</p>

                <p>
                    This module presents a button and text that reads “Notify Tyler”.
                    Pressing the button will send a real-time Discord message to user TylerY2992 (who also happens to be the author of this manual).
                    Tyler will then have the option to solve the module or send a strike to the module. Hopefully you’re on his good side!
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Tyler selects solve, the status light will turn green and the module will solve.
                    However, if Tyler is in a bad mood, he may click the strike prompt and the module will issue you a strike.
                </p>

                <p>In the event that Tyler does not interact with the prompt for 5 minutes, the module will automatically solve.</p>

                <h3>Necessary information about the module:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module <u>cannot</u> give a strike when present on a bomb that was started from the mission binder.</li>
                    <li>All pending Tyler Verifies will solve when Tyler presses the solve button <u>once</u>. For example, if the defuser presses the button on ten Tyler Verifies modules, all ten will solve at the same time when Tyler presses solve. This also applies for strikes, so each module that has been activated will give a strike at the same time. This means that the defuser must be careful and plan the module activations accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Before the button has been pressed, Tyler’s status indicator will be green. Upon pressing the button, it will turn to yellow. It changes back to green upon solving the module. If there is no Internet connection, the indicator will be red.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Note: this module actually sends the user a message, and there’s nothing further that the expert needs to do.
                    This module requires a connection to the World Wide Web.
                    If the module fails to connect at the beginning of the bomb, Tyler’s avatar will change from green to grey and the text “Connection Failed” will appear.
                    Click the button to safely disarm the module.
