                <h2>On the Subject of Halli Galli</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You can hear a mysterious ringing sound. It’s… the Dutch.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module contains 3 face down cards and a call bell. Ring the call bell once to activate the module.</li>
                    <li>Once activated, the three cards will flip over one by one. Once every card has already been flipped over, one will flip back down and flip over again to reveal a new design, continuing the cycle.</li>
                    <li>A card contains anywhere from 0 to 5 of one of the following fruits: strawberries, melons, lemons, raspberries, or bananas.</li>
                    <li>Ring the bell again when there is exactly one fruit currently visible on the module where the total number of that fruit across the visible cards is exactly 5, and when no cards are face down. The cards will flip back over and will not be visible again. Ringing the bell during the cycle when this condition doesn’t apply will cause a strike and the cycle will continue.</li>
                    <li>Consult the table on the left using the counts of the cards that contain this fruit to obtain a digit. If the bell is gold, subtract this digit from 4. If there were 2 cards that summed to 5, and there was another fruit displayed on the module, use the other fruit as the row. Otherwise, use the fruit that summed to 5.</li>
                    <li>Ring the bell a third time when the last digit of the bomb’s timer is this digit or 5 + this digit to solve the module. Striking at this point will revert the module to an unactivated state.</li>
                </ul>
