				<ul>
					<li>Initially, there will be the number 128 written on the module.</li>
					<li>Your friend is mentally suffering. You can help them by being close to them.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Stage I. Getting inside</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>At first, you have to get inside their room. Their door is probably locked from inside, so you have to convince them to open the door.</li>
					<li>To knock, press the center of the module. Every knock will halve the number on the module.</li>
					<li>After every knock, a random number between 1 and the number on the module is chosen. If this random number is equal to 1, then the module’s number will turn green, meaning that the door is unlocked. If the number is green, press the status light and see section “Stage II”.</li>
					<li>If you knock at the wrong time, the number on the module will double and the module will strike.</li>
					<li>If after the first knock the number turned yellow, see section “Stage I.1”.</li>
