                <h2>Appendix CLC-DLC: Identifying Colored Cube variants</h2>
                <p>
                    To identify which Colored Cube variant you are looking at, hover over the cube and note the cube’s selectable elements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the entire cube is selectable:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If it does <strong>not</strong> have a number in top left corner of its top face, you are looking at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3155345012">Colored Cube Simple</a>. Use the table from the first page of this manual to determine when to press the cube. If done correctly, the module will solve, otherwise a strike will be given.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If it <strong>does</strong> have a number in top left corner of its top face, you are looking at <a href="Not Colored Cube.html">Not Colored Cube.</a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the cube is split into 27 smaller cubes, forming a 3×3×3 cube, out of which 25 are selectable, you are looking at <a href="Recolored Cube.html">Recolored Cube</a>.</li>
                    <li>If the cube is split into two equal halves - a front-face half and a back-face half, you are looking at <a href="Uncolored Cube.html">Uncolored Cube</a>.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>all</strong> of the cube’s faces (left, right, front, back and top) are selectable, you are looking at <a href="Colored Cube.html">Colored Cube</a>.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>exactly one</strong> of the left/right/front/back faces is selectable, you are looking at <a href="Decolored Cube.html">Decolored Cube</a>.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>exactly one</strong> of the left/right faces <strong>and exactly one</strong> of the front/back faces are selectable (in other words, two adjacent faces are selectable), you are looking at <a href="Discolored Cube.html">Discolored Cube</a>.</li>
                </ul>
