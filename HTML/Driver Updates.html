                <h2>On the Subject of Driver Updates</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Updates are underway. Please keep your bomb armed.</p>

                <p>The module shows an LCD, an LED matrix and 4 buttons representing previous, next, cancel and confirm in order. While the module was being shipped, some updates came in. To disarm the module, make sure its system is completely up to date. Note that it may take a while before the module manages to fetch its updates.</p>
                <h3>Update Notes</h3>
                <p>The module will show up to five updates, each with update notes. You can scroll through these using the previous and next buttons. Make sure to read through these notes to determine a value. Start with a total of 0. For each update do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the last number of the update's version as a starting value (e.g. v1.6.3 gives a starting value of 3)</li>
                    <li>For each update note in this update, apply the following:
                        <table>
                            <tr><td></td><th>Added</th><th>Removed</th></tr>
                            <tr><th>Positive</th><td>Add 2</td><td>Subtract 1</td></tr>
                            <tr><th>Negative</th><td>Subtract 3</td><td>Add 3</td></tr>
                            <tr><th>Unintelligible</th><td colspan=2>Multiply by -2</td></tr>
                        </table>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Positive items: compatibility, feature, fix, improvement, performance.</li>
                            <li>Negative items: bug, error, exploit, issue, jank.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Apply one final calculation based on the resulting value: (note that 0 is neither positive or negative)
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the value is positive, subtract the value from the total and remove any negative signs. Add 5 afterwards.</li>
                            <li>If the value is negative, double the total and add the value (reducing the total) and remove any negative signs.</li>
                            <li>If the value is exactly zero, halve the total and round up.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your total is greater than 100, subtract 101 until it isn't. When installing the updates, make sure to press confirm when the progress percentage is at most 2% away from this value. If this button is pressed multiple times during installation or if it's not pressed while in the determined range, the download will fail and you'll be sent back.</p>

                <h3>Selection</h3>
                <p>After pressing confirm while in the update notes, the installer will appear. You can always press cancel to return to these update notes. Press confirm while an item is shown to toggle whether it gets installed. The components you can find here are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Program. Cannot be disabled.</li>
                    <li>Libraries. Cannot be disabled.</li>
                    <li>Installer Patch. When enabled, makes sure the installation always succeeds, regardless of interaction with the confirm button.</li>
                    <li>Faster Loading. When enabled, reduces the installation time to 15-30 seconds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next to each of these components there will be a file size displayed.</p>

                <h3>Allocation</h3>
                <p>After selecting the components to install, you will need to assign parts of the system's memory for each component. For this, the LED matrix will display a portion of system memory. Each file can only be stored as a set of rectangles that connect exclusively diagonally. Each rectangle used for the file costs an extra cell worth of memory. Files must be stored in an area exactly fit for their size.</p>
                <p>Pressing confirm when all shapes are placed will let you proceed to the installation.</p>

                <h3>Installation</h3>
                <p>The module will slowly download its updates, showing its progress as a percentage. This may take 2-4 minutes and can be cancelled at any point. If everything goes well, the module will solve automatically after the installation succeeds.</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>Note that this module has more interactions than are described here. No strikes will be incurred at any point and the user is encouraged to explore the functionalities of the system.</p>
