                <h2>On the Subject of the Solar Bowler Reorder</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">No, this is not the Crash level. The game it’s from isn’t even a good one compared to most of the other Crash games. Fight me.</p>
                <p>This module will present you with a grid of 16 buttons and 8 lights.</p>
                <p>The lights can be interacted with, and upon interaction, the module will give you the information needed to solve the module.</p>
                <p>All 8 lights will light up with a certain color, and for approximately 10 seconds after that, all of the buttons will start flashing numbers. The numbers flashed are all in between 1-16, and each button only gets one number which is unique to it and only it. You must remember everything that appeared. Nothing will happen if you interact with the module as this plays.</p>
                <p>Once the buttons have stopped flashing, the lights will also turn off. You may interact with the lights again at this point to display the information once more, but a new permutation of numbers will be generated. The light colors will stay the same for every 3 permutations generated, after which they will also change.</p>
                <p>Using the colors shown by the lights, and the table shown on page 2, rearrange the button numbers into a new sequence. Assume all buttons and numbers are in one long sequence in reading order.</p>
                <p>After the numbers have been rearranged, press all of the buttons in a certain order. A button, once pressed, cannot be pressed again. The lights can still be pressed at any time, and since this resets the permutation, your button inputs will be reset.</p>
                <p>If the serial number contains at least one instance of the letters KFRADY, press the buttons in order based on the number sequence itself, from left to right. For example, if the number sequence began with 9, you would press the 9th button first.</p>
                <p>If the above is not true, instead press the buttons in order based on the position of each number in the number sequence, in ascending order. Using the same example above, if the number sequence began with a 9, the button in the 1st position would be pressed 9th.</p>

                <p>The module will solve if all buttons have been pressed in the correct order. The module will strike otherwise, and indicate which buttons were not pressed at correct times. This will NOT reset the permutation, and you may try again if you wish, as long as you avoid generating a new permutation.</p>
                <h3>The Solar Color (table)</h3>
                <p>Please note that the order of lights is left to right above the buttons, then top to bottom on the right of the buttons. All 8 lights should have their conditions applied in that order.</p>
