                <h2>On the Subject of S</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You’d expect these one-letter modules to have gained some decency after a one-year hiatus of them… Maybe? This one has its own problems…</p>

                <p>This module has 11 colored buttons arranged into an S shape, and 3 unpressable LEDs on the right, representing the 3 stages of this module.
                All 11 colors are unique, but there are 12 possible colors that can appear on the module, with one missing.
                The buttons will flash in a sequence, and there are 3 stages. Stage 1 has 5 flashes, Stage 2 has 6, and Stage 3 has 7.
                There is a long pause in between the ends of the sequence. Additionally, the order of the colors change every stage.
                To solve the module, press the buttons based on increasingly complicated rules.
                The module can't strike or advance until a sufficient amount of inputs have been made.
                Striking will set the module back to the first stage, but will not change anything.</p>

                <h3>Stage 1: Simon Scrambles Substitutions</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 12px"><i>Good thing this step isn't strike-dependent.</i></p>
                <p>Stage 1 has 5 flashes and 5 presses. For each flash, find them in the table below (the row is needed for when the flash happened, and the column is the color).
                The resulting color is the color that you need to press.</p>

                <p>Stage 2 has 6 flashes and 8 presses. In this stage, you will obtain an S-value from modifications of a value.
                However, before that, you will need the positions of the buttons you pressed in Stage 1. To begin, you must first
                determine an R-value.</p>

                <h3>Stage 3: Standard Deviation and S3 from Decay</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 12px"><i>There appear to be remnants of when you would take the standard deviation of 19 elements, which would actually qualify this module to be "objectively bad".
                Good thing it's only 5 elements now. Oh, and I presume S3 just stood out to the creator more than S.</i></p>
                <p>Stage 3 has 7 flashes and a unique press sequence. In this stage, you will obtain the standard deviation of 5 items, and then retrieve a submission sequence using that standard deviation. The 5 items are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The sum of the positions and color values of the 1st and 2nd flashes.</li>
                    <li>The sum of the positions and color values of the 3rd and 4th flashes.</li>
                    <li>The sum of the positions and color values of the 5th and 6th flashes.</li>
                    <li>The sum of R and the sum of the position and color value of the 7th flash.</li>
                    <li>The sum of S and the sum of the color values of the missing colors from all 3 stages.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><i>Note: A "color value" refers to the number of colors you need to go clockwise from Red (0) to get to the color (e.g. Jade has a color value of 5).</i></p>
                <p>Once all 5 values have been obtained, follow this process to obtain your standard deviation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the mean of the 5 items.</li>
                    <li>Replace each item in the list with their absolute differences between themselves and the mean.</li>
                    <li>Square each item in the list.</li>
                    <li>Take the sum of the items in the list.</li>
                    <li>Divide the sum by 4.</li>
                    <li>The standard deviation is the square root of the quotient.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Take the first 4 digits to obtain A. Then, multiply A by the square root of the sum of 111.1 and S, and truncate decimals to get B.</p>
                <p>You are now ready to make the submission sequence S3 using the steps below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide A by B, and retrieve the quotient (X) and remainder (Y).</li>
                    <li>Put X as a list element in S3. All list elements are separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>Store B into A and Y into B.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 1-3 until Y becomes zero (or if otherwise you're attempting to divide by zero).</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Append two commas to S3.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>S3 will be inputted into the module using positions (in the order they appear in S3; colors do not matter).
                All commas are to be interpreted as 10s. Pressing the second 10 in a row will submit your answer.</p>
                <p><u>Submitting the correct answer will solve the module.</u></p>
                <h3>S3 Construction Example</h3>
                <p>For convenience, let’s say that A is 3516, S is 05, and that this module is paired with a Decay. B is equal to A * sqrt(S + 111.1) = ~37884. S3 will be constructed as follows:
                <br>3516 / 37884 = 0 R 3516
                <br>37884 / 3516 = 10 R 2724
                <br>3516 / 2724 = 1 R 792
                <br>2724 / 792 = 3 R 348
                <br>792 / 348 = 2 R 96
                <br>348 / 96 = 3 R 60
                <br>96 / 60 = 1 R 36
                <br>60 / 36 = 1 R 24
                <br>36 / 24 = 1 R 12
                <br>24 / 12 = 2 R 0
                </p><p>
                Pre-reversal:
                <br>0,10,1,3,2,3,1,1,1,2
                </p><p>Submission Sequence (S3):
