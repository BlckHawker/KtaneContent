                <h2>On the Subject of Dripping Triangles</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">No, you’re not having any drip.</p>

                <p><i>Please see <a href="Appendix 1PP1NG.html">Appendix 1PP1NG</a> for identifying modules in the Triangles family.</i></p>

                <p>This module will have 9 triangles on it. Each triangle is coloured yellow, orange, or red. To solve the module, press a valid triangle in no more than three stages. Pressing an invalid triangle will cause a strike. If no more valid triangles are present on the module after pressing a triangle, the module will solve. <u><b>Note that triangles turn off when pressed, regardless of validity.</b></u></p>

                <h3>Identifying valid triangles:</h3>

                <p>Each triangle’s value is dictated by its colour, according to the table below:</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th class="yellow">Yellow</th>
                        <th class="orange">Orange</th>
                        <th class="red">Red</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td>2</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>When a triangle that has a value that is greater than or equal to 3 is ‘toppled’, its value is subtracted by three, and each of its adjacent triangles’ values is increased by 1. Keep toppling triangles that have a value greater than or equal to three until none are left. At this point, the valid triangles are ones that have a value equal to the number of triangles pressed so far. After pressing a triangle, discard all values and start over, considering the triangle that was pressed as an empty space. Empty spaces should not receive a value.</p>
