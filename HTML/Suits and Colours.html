                <h2>On the Subject of Suits and Colours</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Alright. Suit yourself.</p>

                <p>Presented is a 3&times;3 grid of coloured card suits, representing two board states A &amp; B in <i>Lights Out (Footnote FL1CK32)</i>. Find a set of cell presses that changes one of the boards into the other without pressing a cell more than once, then select the cells on the module that are in that set (there will always be one solution). If correct, the cells will go blank, and the small stage indicator will illuminate.</p>
                
                <p>The pressed cells form a new board C &mdash; perform the same procedure you did between A &amp; B (ie. finding a set of cell presses) on A &amp; C and B &amp; C to obtain two new sets of presses, then select the corresponding cells on the module for both sets, in any order, to solve the module.</p>
                
                <p>Striking after the cells have gone blank will enter &ldquo;suspension mode&rdquo; &mdash; the suits and colours will reappear. Pressing any cell will exit this mode.</p>
                
                <h3>Decoding the Boards</h3>
                
                <p>Each cell on the module represents a cell in A &amp; B &mdash; a cell in A starts lit if it is a heart or a diamond, and a cell in B starts lit if it is orange or green.</p>
                <p>For each cell in A, if the number of orthogonally adjacent yellow or green cells is odd, change it from lit to unlit and vice versa.</p>
                <p>For each cell in B, if the number of orthogonally adjacent clubs or diamonds is odd, change it from lit to unlit and vice versa.</p>
                
                <h2>Footnote FL1CK32: Lights Out Rules</h2>
                <p>Lights Out takes place on a grid of cells; each cell can be either black or white. Pressing a cell will invert its colour and the colours of its orthogonally adjacent cells. The grid does not wrap around.</p>
                <p>Usually, the goal of Lights Out is to get from a specific board state to a board filled with black cells, by pressing cells &mdash; however, in this module, you instead need to get from one board to another.</p>
